# Project Introduction: The Blog Hub

This is a project I created as a practice exercise using ReactJS. The project is a blog readin website where users can read blogs, search blogs of different categories. The website is built with a clean and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to find and interact with the content they are interested in.
